Config
======

My Vim config.

Archive
=======

    archive/syntax
    --------------
    Where I store useful syntax files that I normally wouldn't want in a
    'general' configuration of my Vim.

    archive/colors
    --------------
    Where I archive colorscheme files that I've come across, but currently
    don't find useful.

    archive/*
    ---------
    Everything else under archive/ is on a directory basis. Most are unused Vim
    plugins that (in which case it's 1-per-directory) 


Makefile
========

'install' is the only option. Installs to $HOME/ unless $PREFIX is redefined as
such:

    > PREFIX=/other/dir/ make install
